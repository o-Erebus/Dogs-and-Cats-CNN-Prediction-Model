# Dogs vs Cats Image Classification Notebook

This Jupyter Notebook contains code for training a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images of dogs and cats using TensorFlow and Keras. It also includes instructions for downloading the dataset and training the model.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow
- Kaggle API (for downloading the dataset)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/dogs-vs-cats.git
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Downloading Dataset

Before running the code, you need to download the dataset from Kaggle. Follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your Kaggle account or create one if you don't have it.
2. Go to the [Dogs vs. Cats dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats) page on Kaggle.
3. Download the dataset by clicking on the "Download" button.
4. Place the downloaded `kaggle.json` file in the root directory of this repository.

## Usage

Open the Jupyter Notebook `Dogs and Cats Prediction Model.ipynb` and follow the instructions provided within the notebook cells. The notebook guides you through the steps of preprocessing the dataset, training the model, and evaluating its performance.

## Model Architecture

The model architecture consists of a pre-trained InceptionV3 base followed by additional convolutional and dense layers. The key components of the model architecture include:

- Pre-processing of images using TensorFlow's `ImageDataGenerator`.
- Transfer learning using InceptionV3 as the base model.
- Additional convolutional layers followed by max-pooling.
- Dense layers with ReLU activation and dropout regularization.
- Output layer with sigmoid activation for binary classification.

## Results

After training the model, you can analyze the results by referring to the graphs generated within the notebook. These graphs typically include:

Training and validation accuracy over epochs.
